# ios-py
IOS Tidal Package (python) using vector notation.

## History
The IOS Tidal Package is a set of programs, manuals, and test data for analysing and predicting tidal elevation and/or current time series. 
The [original package](http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/oceans/tidal-marees/index-eng.html) was developed by Mike Foreman at Fisheries and Oceans Canada (mike.foreman@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) 

## Intent
The goal of IOS-py is to convert the code from FORTRAN77 to python using vector notation. This will increase performance and allows uers to perform tidal analyses on million of points.
